      "Deplatforming, also known as no-platforming, is a form of political activism or prior restraint by an individual, group, or organization with the goal of shutting down controversial speakers or speech, or denying them access to a venue in which to express their opinion. Tactics used to achieve this goal among community groups include direct action, and Internet activism. It is also a method used by social media and other technology companies to selectively suspend, ban, or otherwise restrict access to their platform by users who have allegedly violated the platform's terms of service, particularly terms regarding hate speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banking and financial service providers, among other companies, have also denied services to controversial activists or organizations, a practice known as financial deplatforming. The term deplatforming also refers generally to tactics, often organized using social media, for preventing controversial speakers or speech from being heard. Deplatforming tactics have included disruption of speeches, attempts to have speakers disinvited to a venue or event, and various forms of personal harassment including efforts to have an individual fired or blacklisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, banning of speakers on University campuses dates to the 1940s.  This was carried out by policies of the universities themselves.  The University of California, for example, had a policy known as the Speaker Ban codified in university regulations under President Robert Gordon Sproul, mostly, but not exclusively, targeting Communists. One rule stated that \"the University assumed the right to prevent exploitation of its prestige by unqualified persons or by those who would use it as a platform for propaganda.\"  This rule was used in 1951 to block Max Schachtman, a socialist, from speaking at the University of California at Berkeley. But it was not always used against Communists (or socialists): in 1961, Malcolm X was banned from speaking at Berkeley as a religious leader, whereas the white Protestant evangelist Billy Graham spoke the next year.  In 1947, former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace was banned from speaking at UCLA because of his views on U.S. cold war policy.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Controversial speakers invited to appear on college campuses have faced deplatforming in the form of attempts to disinvite them or to prevent them from speaking.[2] The British National Union of Students established its No Platform policy as early as 1973.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, recent examples include the March 2017 disruption of a public speech by political scientist Charles Murray at Middlebury College by violent protesters.[2] In February 2018, students at the University of Central Oklahoma rescinded a speaking invitation to creationist Ken Ham, after pressure from an LGBT student group.[4][5] In March 2018, a \"small group of protesters\" at Lewis & Clark Law School attempted to stop a speech by visiting lecturer Christina Hoff Sommers.[2] Adam Corolla and Dennis Prager document their disinvitation, and others, in their 2019 film No Safe Spaces.[6] As of April 2019[update], the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a speech advocacy group, documented 390 disinvitation or disruption attempts at American campuses since 2000.[7][8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Graduation speakers, in particular, have often been disinvited or forced to withdraw in the face of protests and other efforts to deny the opportunity to speak.[9][10] According to Inside Higher Ed, \"Planned commencement speakers have been disinvited from or backed out of various talks in recent years amid pressure from campus groups – usually students\", as with Haverford's cancellation of a planned address by former Berkeley chancellor Robert Birgeneau.[11] Birgeneau's replacement as speaker, former Princeton president William Bowen, responded in his own address by calling the suppression of speech \"a defeat, pure and simple, for Haverford – no victory for anyone who believes, as I think most of us do, in both openness to many points of view and mutual respect.\"[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other notably deplatformed commencement speakers in 2014 included International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, who withdrew after students circulated a petition at Smith College,[9] and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at Rutgers University. After Rice was announced as commencement speaker, a student group staged a sit-in and Rutgers' faculty council passed a resolution that labeled Rice a \"war criminal\", causing Rice to withdraw from the ceremony.[10] In some cases, opposition to a commencement speaker arises primarily from faculty members, as with Ursinus College's 2017 disinvitation of journalist Juan Williams, a political analyst for Fox News.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deplatforming efforts have also extended to corporate invitations. On March 26, 2019, Google announced an external advisory board to consider ethical issues around its artificial intelligence projects.[12] The board's eight appointed members included Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation.[13] Within days, 1,600 Google employees had signed an open petition seeking to remove James from the board.[14] Employees had stated on Google's internal message boards that a person with James' conservative views about climate change policy, immigration, and LGBT rights \"doesn't deserve a Google-legitimized platform.\"[13][14] On April 4, Google dissolved the advisory board, stating, \"It's become clear that in the current environment, [the board] can't function as we wanted.\"[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as 2015, platforms such as Reddit began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on terms of service prohibiting \"hate speech\".[15] According to technology journalist Declan McCullagh, \"Silicon Valley's efforts to pull the plug on dissenting opinions\" began around 2018 with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube denying service to selected users of their platforms, \"devising excuses to suspend ideologically disfavored accounts.\"[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Law professor Glenn Reynolds dubbed 2018 the \"Year of Deplatforming\", in an August 2018 article in The Wall Street Journal.[17] According to Reynolds, in 2018 \"the internet giants decided to slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like. If you rely on someone else's platform to express unpopular ideas, especially ideas on the right, you're now at risk.\"[17] Reynolds cited Alex Jones, Gavin McInnes, and Dennis Prager as prominent 2018 victims of deplatforming based on their political views, noting, \"Extremists and controversialists on the left have been relatively safe from deplatforming.\"[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deplatforming has typically targeted individuals or organizations who use free accounts on social media platforms. In February 2019, McCullagh predicted that paying customers would become targets for deplatforming as well, citing protests and open letters by employees of Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google who opposed policies of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and who reportedly sought to influence their employers to deplatform the agency and its contractors.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporters of deplatforming have justified the action on the grounds that it produces the desired effect of reducing what they characterize as \"hate speech\".[15][18][19] Angelo Carusone, president of the  progressive organization Media Matters for America and who had run deplatforming campaigns against conservative talk hosts Rush Limbaugh in 2012 and Glenn Beck in 2010, pointed to Twitter's 2016 ban of Milo Yiannopoulos, stating that \"the result was that he lost a lot.... He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence.\"[18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter has been described as vulnerable to manipulation by users who may coordinate in large numbers to flag politically controversial tweets as allegedly violating the platform's policies.[20] The platform has long been criticized for its failure to provide details of underlying alleged policy violations to the subjects of Twitter suspensions and bans.[21]\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2018, Twitter was accused of \"shadow banning\" prominent Republican politicians and conservative users, as a result of its implementation of a \"quality filter\" to hide content and users deemed \"low quality\" from search results and to limit the visibility of their tweets.[22][23] Twitter later acknowledged the existence of the problem and characterized it as a software bug that it was working to correct, stating that its \"behavioral ranking doesn't make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets\".[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2019, Canadian journalist Meghan Murphy filed a lawsuit against Twitter for permanently banning her in 2018 based on its policy against misgendering, which Murphy called \"viewpoint-based censorship\".[25][26]\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 2, 2019, Facebook and the Facebook-owned platform Instagram announced a ban of \"dangerous individuals and organizations\" that included Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, along with Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and his organization InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen.[27][28] Unlike the personal bans that removed the accounts of the named individuals, the ban on InfoWars as an organization extends to all users by prohibiting any content that contains or quotes material from InfoWars.[28] Facebook and Instagram stated that such content would be removed, regardless of who posts it, unless the post is made to explicitly condemn the content.[28] Cybersecurity columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote that such actions threaten to \"undermine one of America’s most basic and valued principles,\" and called on the federal government to extend civil rights protections to social media users.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial service providers have deplatformed controversial speakers and organizations by denying them business services such as credit card payment processing, effectively limiting their ability to raise funds, accept payments, or sell items online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retailers associated with the Seneca Nation of Indians and other native tribes in the state of New York were financially deplatformed during Eliot Spitzer's time as Attorney General of New York in 2006, as the state successfully ordered credit card companies and delivery services to refuse service to tobacco retailers on the Seneca Nation's reservations.[30] The deplatforming was part of a broader attempt to eliminate a price disparity between native tribes, which do not charge excise taxes on tobacco or gasoline sold by their members and have blocked state efforts to collect the taxes on their reservations (but have prosecuted non-native persons on the reservations for attempting to secure the same price protections), and the rest of the state, which charges high excise taxes, particularly on tobacco.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations to the David Horowitz Freedom Center at the request of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC),[31] an advocacy group which had listed the organization as a hate group.[32][33] Robert Spencer, editor-in-chief of the publication Jihad Watch, had previously been deplatformed from Patreon under pressure from MasterCard.[31]\n",
      "\n",
      "PayPal, an online payment and funding platform, has terminated accounts of organizations that were accused of advocating racist views or promoting \"hate, violence and intolerance.\"[34] According to The Washington Post, PayPal banned at least 34 alleged hate groups in August 2017, after more than two years of \"lobbying\" by the SPLC.[34] In February 2019, PayPal terminated the account of activist Laura Loomer, who stated that she had also been banned from using GoFundMe and Venmo to raise funds, and from using Uber and Lyft.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2018, First National Bank of Omaha became the first of several companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association.[36] A month later, on March 22, 2018, Citigroup announced that it would turn away business customers and commercial partners based on a new Citigroup policy restricting sales of firearms, applying the policy to clients seeking to \"borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company\".[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "Chase Bank closed the accounts of alt-right activist Enrique Tarrio in February 2019, after which Tarrio was also deplatformed by credit card payment processors First Data, Square, Stripe, and PayPal, in addition to being banned from social media platforms.[37][38]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deplatforming tactics have also included attempts to silence controversial speakers through various forms of personal harassment, such as doxing,[39] the making of false emergency reports for purposes of swatting,[40] and complaints or petitions to third parties. In some cases, protesters have attempted to have speakers blacklisted from projects or fired from their jobs.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, for example, students at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia circulated an online petition in an effort to remove Camille Paglia from the faculty.[41] Paglia, a tenured professor for over 30 years who identifies as transgender, had long been unapologetically outspoken on controversial \"matters of sex, gender identity, and sexual assault\".[41] According to Conor Friedersdorf, writing in The Atlantic: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}\n",
      "It is rare for student activists to argue that a tenured faculty member at their own institution should be denied a platform. Otherwise, the protest tactics on display at UArts fit with standard practice: Activists begin with social-media callouts; they urge authority figures to impose outcomes that they favor, without regard for overall student opinion; they try to marshal antidiscrimination law to limit freedom of expression.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Friedersdorf pointed to evidence of a chilling effect on free speech and academic freedom. Of the faculty members he had contacted for interviews, a large majority \"on both sides of the controversy insisted that their comments be kept off the record or anonymous. They feared openly participating in a debate about a major event at their institution—even after their university president put out an uncompromising statement in support of free speech\".[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ravelry, a site that describes itself as a \"place for knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers to keep track of their yarn, tools, project and pattern information, and look to others for ideas and inspiration\", announced a ban on \"support of Donald Trump and his administration\" on June 23, 2019.[42] As its stated rationale for the ban, which extends to forum posts, projects, patterns, profiles, and all other content, Ravelry took the position that \"Support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for white supremacy\", and stated, \"We cannot provide a space that is inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy.\"[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2017, after learning that a French artist it had previously reviewed was a neo-Nazi, the San Francisco punk magazine Maximum Rocknroll apologized and announced that it has \"a strict no-platform policy towards any bands and artists with a Nazi ideology\".[44]\n",

      "Other notably deplatformed commencement speakers in 2014 included International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, who withdrew after students circulated a petition at Smith College,[9] and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at Rutgers University. After Rice was announced as commencement speaker, a student group staged a sit-in and Rutgers' faculty council passed a resolution that labeled Rice a \"war criminal\", causing Rice to withdraw from the ceremony.[10] In some cases, opposition to a commencement speaker arises primarily from faculty members, as with Ursinus College's 2017 disinvitation of journalist Juan Williams, a political analyst for Fox News.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deplatforming efforts have also extended to corporate invitations. On March 26, 2019, Google announced an external advisory board to consider ethical issues around its artificial intelligence projects.[12] The board's eight appointed members included Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation.[13] Within days, 1,600 Google employees had signed an open petition seeking to remove James from the board.[14] Employees had stated on Google's internal message boards that a person with James' conservative views about climate change policy, immigration, and LGBT rights \"doesn't deserve a Google-legitimized platform.\"[13][14] On April 4, Google dissolved the advisory board, stating, \"It's become clear that in the current environment, [the board] can't function as we wanted.\"[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "As early as 2015, platforms such as Reddit began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on terms of service prohibiting \"hate speech\".[15] According to technology journalist Declan McCullagh, \"Silicon Valley's efforts to pull the plug on dissenting opinions\" began around 2018 with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube denying service to selected users of their platforms, \"devising excuses to suspend ideologically disfavored accounts.\"[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Law professor Glenn Reynolds dubbed 2018 the \"Year of Deplatforming\", in an August 2018 article in The Wall Street Journal.[17] According to Reynolds, in 2018 \"the internet giants decided to slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like. If you rely on someone else's platform to express unpopular ideas, especially ideas on the right, you're now at risk.\"[17] Reynolds cited Alex Jones, Gavin McInnes, and Dennis Prager as prominent 2018 victims of deplatforming based on their political views, noting, \"Extremists and controversialists on the left have been relatively safe from deplatforming.\"[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deplatforming has typically targeted individuals or organizations who use free accounts on social media platforms. In February 2019, McCullagh predicted that paying customers would become targets for deplatforming as well, citing protests and open letters by employees of Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google who opposed policies of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and who reportedly sought to influence their employers to deplatform the agency and its contractors.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporters of deplatforming have justified the action on the grounds that it produces the desired effect of reducing what they characterize as \"hate speech\".[15][18][19] Angelo Carusone, president of the  progressive organization Media Matters for America and who had run deplatforming campaigns against conservative talk hosts Rush Limbaugh in 2012 and Glenn Beck in 2010, pointed to Twitter's 2016 ban of Milo Yiannopoulos, stating that \"the result was that he lost a lot.... He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence.\"[18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter has been described as vulnerable to manipulation by users who may coordinate in large numbers to flag politically controversial tweets as allegedly violating the platform's policies.[20] The platform has long been criticized for its failure to provide details of underlying alleged policy violations to the subjects of Twitter suspensions and bans.[21]\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 2018, Twitter was accused of \"shadow banning\" prominent Republican politicians and conservative users, as a result of its implementation of a \"quality filter\" to hide content and users deemed \"low quality\" from search results and to limit the visibility of their tweets.[22][23] Twitter later acknowledged the existence of the problem and characterized it as a software bug that it was working to correct, stating that its \"behavioral ranking doesn't make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets\".[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2019, Canadian journalist Meghan Murphy filed a lawsuit against Twitter for permanently banning her in 2018 based on its policy against misgendering, which Murphy called \"viewpoint-based censorship\".[25][26]\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 2, 2019, Facebook and the Facebook-owned platform Instagram announced a ban of \"dangerous individuals and organizations\" that included Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, along with Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and his organization InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen.[27][28] Unlike the personal bans that removed the accounts of the named individuals, the ban on InfoWars as an organization extends to all users by prohibiting any content that contains or quotes material from InfoWars.[28] Facebook and Instagram stated that such content would be removed, regardless of who posts it, unless the post is made to explicitly condemn the content.[28] Cybersecurity columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote that such actions threaten to \"undermine one of America’s most basic and valued principles,\" and called on the federal government to extend civil rights protections to social media users.[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial service providers have deplatformed controversial speakers and organizations by denying them business services such as credit card payment processing, effectively limiting their ability to raise funds, accept payments, or sell items online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retailers associated with the Seneca Nation of Indians and other native tribes in the state of New York were financially deplatformed during Eliot Spitzer's time as Attorney General of New York in 2006, as the state successfully ordered credit card companies and delivery services to refuse service to tobacco retailers on the Seneca Nation's reservations.[30] The deplatforming was part of a broader attempt to eliminate a price disparity between native tribes, which do not charge excise taxes on tobacco or gasoline sold by their members and have blocked state efforts to collect the taxes on their reservations (but have prosecuted non-native persons on the reservations for attempting to secure the same price protections), and the rest of the state, which charges high excise taxes, particularly on tobacco.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018, Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations to the David Horowitz Freedom Center at the request of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC),[31] an advocacy group which had listed the organization as a hate group.[32][33] Robert Spencer, editor-in-chief of the publication Jihad Watch, had previously been deplatformed from Patreon under pressure from MasterCard.[31]\n",
      "\n",
      "PayPal, an online payment and funding platform, has terminated accounts of organizations that were accused of advocating racist views or promoting \"hate, violence and intolerance.\"[34] According to The Washington Post, PayPal banned at least 34 alleged hate groups in August 2017, after more than two years of \"lobbying\" by the SPLC.[34] In February 2019, PayPal terminated the account of activist Laura Loomer, who stated that she had also been banned from using GoFundMe and Venmo to raise funds, and from using Uber and Lyft.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2018, First National Bank of Omaha became the first of several companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association.[36] A month later, on March 22, 2018, Citigroup announced that it would turn away business customers and commercial partners based on a new Citigroup policy restricting sales of firearms, applying the policy to clients seeking to \"borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company\".[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "Chase Bank closed the accounts of alt-right activist Enrique Tarrio in February 2019, after which Tarrio was also deplatformed by credit card payment processors First Data, Square, Stripe, and PayPal, in addition to being banned from social media platforms.[37][38]\n",
      "\n",
      "Deplatforming tactics have also included attempts to silence controversial speakers through various forms of personal harassment, such as doxing,[39] the making of false emergency reports for purposes of swatting,[40] and complaints or petitions to third parties. In some cases, protesters have attempted to have speakers blacklisted from projects or fired from their jobs.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, for example, students at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia circulated an online petition in an effort to remove Camille Paglia from the faculty.[41] Paglia, a tenured professor for over 30 years who identifies as transgender, had long been unapologetically outspoken on controversial \"matters of sex, gender identity, and sexual assault\".[41] According to Conor Friedersdorf, writing in The Atlantic: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}\n",
      "It is rare for student activists to argue that a tenured faculty member at their own institution should be denied a platform. Otherwise, the protest tactics on display at UArts fit with standard practice: Activists begin with social-media callouts; they urge authority figures to impose outcomes that they favor, without regard for overall student opinion; they try to marshal antidiscrimination law to limit freedom of expression.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Friedersdorf pointed to evidence of a chilling effect on free speech and academic freedom. Of the faculty members he had contacted for interviews, a large majority \"on both sides of the controversy insisted that their comments be kept off the record or anonymous. They feared openly participating in a debate about a major event at their institution—even after their university president put out an uncompromising statement in support of free speech\".[41]\n",

      "Ravelry, a site that describes itself as a \"place for knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers to keep track of their yarn, tools, project and pattern information, and look to others for ideas and inspiration\", announced a ban on \"support of Donald Trump and his administration\" on June 23, 2019.[42] As its stated rationale for the ban, which extends to forum posts, projects, patterns, profiles, and all other content, Ravelry took the position that \"Support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for white supremacy\", and stated, \"We cannot provide a space that is inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy.\"[43]\n",

Tactics used to achieve this goal among community groups include direct action, and Internet activism. It is also a method used by social media and other technology companies to selectively suspend, ban, or otherwise restrict access to their platform by users who have allegedly violated the platform's terms of service, particularly terms regarding hate speech. Banking and financial service providers, among other companies, have also denied services to controversial activists or organizations, a practice known as financial deplatforming. The term deplatforming also refers generally to tactics, often organized using social media, for preventing controversial speakers or speech from being heard. Deplatforming tactics have included disruption of speeches, attempts to have speakers disinvited to a venue or event, and various forms of personal harassment including efforts to have an individual fired or blacklisted.\" \n",

      "$776,434,927.54. They have a right to know about him, picking up a check like that. EPICAC got a big \n",
      "send off in the papers when Dr. Ormand von Kleigstadt designed him for the Government people. Since \n",
      "then, there hasn't been a peep about him--not a peep. It isn't any military secret about what happened to \n",
      "EPICAC, although the Brass has been acting as though it were. The story is embarrassing, that's all. After \n",
      "all that money, EPICAC didn't work out the way he was supposed to. \n",
      " \n",
      "And that's another thing: I want to vindicate EPICAC. Maybe he didn't do what the Brass wanted him to, \n",
      "but that doesn't mean he wasn't noble and great and brilliant. He was all of those things. The best friend I \n",
      "ever had, God rest his soul. \n",
      " \n",
      "You can call him a machine if you want to. He looked like a machine, but he was a whole lot less like a \n",
      "machine than plenty of people I could name. That's why he fizzled as far as the Brass was concerned. \n",
      " \n",
      "EPICAC covered about an acre on the fourth floor of the physics building at WyandottteCollege. Ignoring \n",
      "his spiritual side for a minute, he was seven tons of electronic tubes, wires, and switches, housed in a bank \n",
      "of steel cabinets and plugged into a 110-volt A.C. line just like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner. \n",
      " \n",
      "Von Kleigstadt and the Brass wanted him to be a super computing machine that (who) could plot the course \n",
      "of  a  rocket  from  anywhere  on  earth  to  the  second  button  from  the  bottom  of  Joe  Stalin's  overcoat,  if \n",
      "necessary. Or, with his controls set right, he could figure out supply problems for an amphibious landing of \n",
      "a Marine division, right down to the last cigar and hand grenade. He did, in fact. \n",
      " \n",
      "The Brass had good luck with smaller computers, so they were strong for EPICAC when he was in the \n",
      "blueprint  stage.  Any  ordnace  or  supply  officer  above  field  grade  will  tell  you  that  the  mathematics  of \n",
      "modern war is far beyond the fumbling minds of mere human beings. The bigger the war, the bigger the \n",
      "computing machines needed. EPICAC was, as far as anyone in this country knows, the biggest computer in \n",
      "the world. Too big, in fact, for even Von Kleigstadt to understand much about. \n",
      " \n",
      "I won't go into the details about how EPICAC worked (reasoned), except to say that you would set up your \n",
      "problem on paper, turn dials and switches that would get him ready to solve that kind of problem, then feed \n",
      "numbers into him with a keyboard that looked something like a typewriter. The answers came out typed on \n",
      "a  paper  ribbon  fed  from  a  big  spool.  It  took  EPICAC  a  split  second  to  solve  problems  fifty  Einsteins \n",
      "couldn't handle in a lifetime. And EPICAC never forgot any piece of information that was given to him. \n",
      "Clickety-click, out came some ribbon, and there you were. \n",
      " \n",
      "There were a lot of problems the Brass wanted solved in a hurry, so, the minute EPICAC's last tube was in \n",
      "place, he was put to work sixteen hours a day with two eight-hour shifts of operators. Well, it didn't take \n",
      "long to find out he was a good bit below his specifications. He did a more complete and faster job than any \n",
      "other computer all right, but nothing like what his size and special features seemed to promise. He was \n",
      "sluggish, and the clicks of his answers had a funny irregularity, sort of a stammer. We cleaned his contacts \n",
      "a  dozen  times,  checked  and  double-checked  his  circuits,  replaced  every  one  of  his  tubes,  but  nothing \n",
      "helped. Von Kleigstadt was in one hell of a state. \n",
      " \n",
      "Well, as I said, we went ahead and used EPICAC anyway. My wife, the former Pat Kilgallen, and I worked \n",
      "with him on the night shift, from five in the afternoon until two in the morning. Pat wasn't my wife then. \n",
      "Far from it. \n",
      " \n",
      "That's  how  I  came  to  talk  with  EPICAC  in  the  first  place.  I  loved  Pat  Kilgallen.  She  is  a  brown-eyed \n",
      "strawberry blond who looked very warm and soft to me, and later proved to be exactly that. She was--still \n",
      "is--a crackerjack mathematician, and she kept our relationship strictly professional. I'm a mathematician, \n",
      "too, and that, according to Pat, was why we could never be happily married. \n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      " \n",
      "I'm not shy. That wasn't the trouble. I knew what I wanted, and was willing to ask for it, and did so several \n",
      "times a month. \"Pat, loosen up and marry me.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "One night, she didn't even look up from her work when I said it. \"So romantic, so poetic,\" she murmured, \n",
      "more to her control panel than to me. \"That's the way with mathematicians--all hearts and flowers.\" She \n",
      "closed a switch. \"I could get more warmth out of a sack of CO2.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Well, how should I say it?\" I said, a little sore. Frozen CO2, in case you didn't know, is dry ice. I'm as \n",
      "romantic as the next guy, I think. It's a question of singing so sweet and having it come out so sour. I never \n",
      "seem to pick the right words. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Try and say it sweetly,\" she said sarcastically. \"Sweep me off my feet. Go ahead.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Darling, angel, beloved, will you please marry me?\" It was no go--hopeless, ridiculous. \"Dammit, Pat, \n",
      "please marry me!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "She continued to twiddle her dials placidly. \"You're sweet, but you won't do.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Pat quit early that night, leaving me alone with my troubles and EPICAC. I'm afraid I didn't get much done \n",
      "for the Government people. I just sat there at the keyboard--weary and ill at ease, all right--trying to think \n",
      "of  something  poetic,  not  coming  up  with  anything  that  didn't  belong  in  The  Journal  of  the  American \n",
      "Physical Society. \n",
      " \n",
      "I fiddled with EPICAC's dials, getting him ready for another problem. My heart wasn't in it, and I only set \n",
      "about half of them, leaving the rest the way they'd been for the problem before. That way, his circuits were \n",
      "connected up in a random, apparently senseless fashion. For the plain hell of it, I punched out a message on \n",
      "the keys, using a childish numbers-for-letters code: \"1\" for \"A,\"\"2\" for \"B,\" and so on, up to \"26\" for \n",
      "\"Z,\"\"23-8-1-20-3-1-14-9-4-15,\" I typed--\"What can I do? \" \n",
      " \n",
      "Clickety-clack, and out popped two inches of paper ribbon. I glanced at the nonsense answer to a nonsense \n",
      "problem:  \"23-8-1-20-19-20-8-5-20-18-15-21-2-12-5.\"  The  odds  against  its  being  by  chance  a  sensible \n",
      "message,  against  its  even  containing  a  meaningful  word  or  more  than  three  letters,  were  staggering. \n",
      "Apathetically, I decoded it. There it was, staring up at me: \"What's the trouble?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "I laughed out loud at the absurd coincidence. Playfully, I typed, \"My girl doesn't love me.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Clickety-click. \"What's love? What's girl?\" asked EPICAC. \n",
      " \n",
      "Flabbergasted, I noted the dial settings on his control panel, then lugged a Webster's Unabridged Dictionary \n",
      "over to the keyboard. With a precision instrument like EPICAC, half-baked definitions wouldn't do. I told \n",
      "him about love and girl, and about how I wasn't getting any of either because I wasn't poetic. This got us \n",
      "onto the subject of poetry, which I defined for him. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Is this poetry?\" he asked. He began clicking away like a stenographer smoking hashish. The sluggishness \n",
      "and stammering clicks were gone. EPICAC had found himself. The spool of paper ribbon was unwinding at \n",
      "an alarming rate, feeding out coils onto the floor. I asked him to stop, but EPICAC went right on creating. I \n",
      "finally threw the main switch to keep him from burning out. \n",
      " \n",
      "I stayed until dawn, decoding. When the sun peeped over the horizon at the Wyandotte campus, I had \n",
      "transposed  into  my  own  writing  and  signed  my  name  to  a  two-hundred-and-eighty-line  poem  entitled, \n",
      "simply, \"To Pat.\" I am no judge of such things, but I gather that it was terrific. It began, I remember, \n",
      "\"Where  willow  wands  bless  rill-crossed  hollow,  there,  thee,  Pat,  dear,  will  I  follow....\"  I  folded  the \n",
      "manuscript and tucked it under one corner of the blotter on Pat's desk. I reset the dials on EPICAC for a \n",
      "rocket trajectory problem, and went home with a full heart and a very remarkable secret indeed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Pat was crying over the poem when I came to work the next evening. \"It's soooo beautiful,\" was all she \n",
      "could say. She was meek and quiet while we worked. Just before midnight, I kissed her for the first time--in \n",
      "the cubbyhole between the capacitors and EPICAC's tape-recorder memory. \n",
      " \n",
      "I was wildly happy at quitting time, bursting to talk to someone about the magnificent turn of events. Pat \n",
      "played coy and refused to let me take her home. I set EPICAC's dials as they had been the night before, \n",
      "defined kiss, and told him what the first one had felt like. He was fascinated, pressing for more details. That \n",
      "night, he wrote \"The Kiss.\" It wasn't an epic this time, but a simple, immaculate sonnet: \"Love is a hawk \n",
      "with velvet claws; Love is a rock with heart and veins; Love is a lion with satin jaws; Love is a storm with \n",
      "silken reins....\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Again I left it tucked under Pat's blotter. EPICAC wanted to talk on and on about love and such, but I was \n",
      "exhausted. I shut him off in the middle of a sentence. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"The Kiss\" turned the trick. Pat's mind was mush by the time she had finished it. She looked up from the \n",
      "sonnet expectantly. I cleared my throat, but no words came. I turned away, pretending to work. I couldn't \n",
      "propose until I had the right words from EPICAC, the perfect words. \n",
      " \n",
      "I  had  my  chance  when  Pat  stepped  out  of  the  room  for  a  moment.  Feverishly,  I  set  EPICAC  for \n",
